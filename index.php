<!--
Wingfall The further you fall, the higher your score. Wingfall is a physics simulation game based around the aerodynamic drag force of free falling!
What is your freefalling strategy? Slow and steady or drop it like itâ€™s hot? Tilt your freefaller side to side and back to front achieve the perfect angle. Balance your speed and don't lose control!
Time is on your side, but the sky is not. Crashing into a cloud means game over. The same goes for flying out of bounds.
Happy falling!
Features:

   * easy to play, hard to master

   * lose to your friends in Game Center (because they don't have a life)
